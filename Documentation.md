Built a "Smart Food Ordering System with ESP32 + OLED Display" along with Md. Nahid Hasan for preliminary round of MIE ROBOlution 1.0 Techathon 2025!!!
Designed and simulated a complete embedded project that lets users select food items, adjust quantities, and place orders — all using buttons and an OLED screen. Integrated Firebase for real-time data sync, allowing restaurant owners to view and manage orders remotely.
Features:
⚪OLED-based food menu interface
⚪Long-press logic for cart and reset actions
⚪Dynamic cart system
⚪Real-time data send/receive via Firebase
⚪Tested on actual ESP32 hardware

Hands-on learning in embedded systems, UI logic, and IoT backend integration — combining electronics with software in a meaningful way!

Future Enhancements(Hardware):
⚪Add NFC or QR code scanning for user/table identification
⚪Introduce touch screen or voice-based input for better UX
⚪Display estimated wait times and order status updates
⚪Add kitchen-side ESP32 for real-time order updates & status tracking
⚪Use an app interface to sync multiple tables with admin control

Future Enhancements with Machine Learning(already working on it):
⚪ Personalized food recommendations based on order history
⚪ Predictive wait time estimation based on kitchen load and past data
⚪ Sales trend analysis to optimize menu or inventory
⚪ Anomaly detection for unusual ordering patterns or system faults
⚪ User behavior analytics to improve UX and optimize menu layout
